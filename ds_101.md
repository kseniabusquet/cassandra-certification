## DS101: Introduction to Apache Cassandra

### Relational Databases

#### Medium Data

- fits on 1 machine
- RDBMS is fine
  - postgres
  - mysql
- Supports hundreds of concurrent users
- ACID makes us feel good (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability)

#### Can RDBMS work for big data?

Replication: ACID is a lie!

Data is replicated asynchronously, known as replication lag

![Replication Lag](img/replication_lag.png)

#### Third Normal Form Doesn't Scale

- Queries are unpredictable
- Users are impatient
- Data must be denormalized
- If data > memory, you = history
- Disk seeks are the worst

![Crazy Query](img/crazy_relational_query.png)

#### Sharding is a nightmare

> instead of having all the data in one database, in one master, you split it up in multiple databases.

- Data is all over the place
- No more joints
- No more aggregations
- Denormalize all the things
- Querying secondary indexes requires hitting every shard
- Adding shards requires manually moving data
- Schema changes

#### High Availability.. not really

- Master failover.. who's responsible?
  - Another moving part
  - Bolted on hack
- Multi-DC is a mess
- Downtime is frequent
  - Change database settings (innodb buffer pool etc.)
  - Drive, power supply failures
  - OS updates

#### Summary of failure

- Scaling is a pain
- ACID is naive at best
  - You aren't consistent
- Re-sharding is a manual process
- We're going to denormalize for performance
- High availability is complicated, requires additional operational overhead

#### Lessons Learned

- Consistency is not practical
  - So we give it up
- Manual sharding & rebalancing is hard
  - So let's build in
- Every moving part makes systems more complex
  - So let's simplify our architecture - no more master/slave
- Scaling is expensive
  - We want commodity software
- Scatter/gather no good
  - We denormalize for real time query performance
  - Goal is to always hit 1 machine

### Cassandra Overview

#### What is Apache Cassandra?

- Fast distributed database
- High availability
- Linear scalability
- Predictable performance
- No SPOF
- Multi-Datacenter
- Commodity hardware
- Easy to manage operationally
- Not a drop in replacement for RDBMS

![Scale Up Linearity](img/scale_up_linearity.png)

#### Hash Ring

![Hash Ring](img/hash_ring.png)

- No master / slave / replica sets
- No config servers, zookeper
- Data is partitioned around the ring
- Data is replicated to RF=N servers
- All nodes hold data and can answer queries (both reads & writes)
- Location of data on ring is determined by partition key

#### Partition key

Part of a primary key, used for locating the range od hashes (bucket) inside the hash ring to address the correct node.

#### CAP Tradeoffs

![CAP](img/cap_theorem.png)

- Impossible to be both consistent and highly available during a network partition
- Latency between data centers also makes consistency impractical
- Cassandra chooses **Availability & Partition Tolerance** over Consistency (AP)

#### Replication

![Replication](img/replication.png)

- Data is replicated automatically
- You pick number of servers
- Called **replication factor or RF**
- Data is ALWAYS replicated to each replica
- If a machine is down, missing data is replayed via **hinted handoff** (remaining nodes save mutations locally as hints and when the node comes back up, the hints are replayed to the node to sync the data)

#### Consistency Levels

![Consistency levels](img/consistency_levels.png)

- Per query consistency
- ALL, QUORUM, ONE
- How many replicas for query to respond OK

**Direct impact:**
- sped of reads & writes
- affects availability (high consistency level -> more dependency on the nodes going down)

#### Multi Datacenter

![Multi DC](image.png)

- Typical Usage: clients write to local DC, replicates async to other DCs
- Replication factor per keyspace per datacenter
- Datacenters can be physical or logical

### Cassandra Internals and Choosing a Distribution

#### The Write Path

![Write Path](img/write_path.png)

- Writes are written to any node in the cluster (coordinator)
- Writes are written to **commit log**, then to **memtable**
- Every write includes a timestamp
- Memtable flushed to disk periodically (**sstable**)
- New memtable is created in memory
- Deletes are a special write case, called a **tombstone** (a marker that says there is no data here anymore)

Cassandra is VERY fast in writing data because of the simplicity of the write path.

##### What is an SSTable?

![SSTable](img/sstable.png)

- Immutable data file for row storage
- Every write includes a timestamp of when it was written
- Partition is spread across multiple SSTables
- Same column can be in multiple SSTables
- Merged through compaction, only latest timestamp is kept
- Deletes are written as tombstones
- Easy backups

#### The Read Path

![The Read Path](img/read_path.png)

- Any server may be queried, it acts as the coordinator
- Contacts nodes with the requested key
- On each node, data is pulled from SSTables and merged if there is some unflushed data
- Consistency < ALL performs **read repair** in the background (**read_repair_chance**)
